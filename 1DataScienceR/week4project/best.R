# Script Function: Finding the best hospital in a state
# Function name: best
# Specifications:
#     - arguments:
#         1) the 2-character abbreviated name of a state
#         2) outcome name
# Data Source: outcome-of-care-measures.csv
# Return:
#     - returns character vector with name of the hospital that has the best
#       (i.e. lowest) 30-day mortality for the specified outcome in that state.
#       The hospital name is the name provided in the Hospital.Name variable.
#       + The outcomes can be one of:
#         -"heart attack"
#         -"heart failure"
#         -"pneumonia"
# Corner Cases:
#     - Hospitals that do not have data on a particular outcome should be excluded
#       from the set of hospitals when deciding the rankings
#     - Handling ties: If there is a tie for the best hospital for a given outcome,
#       then the hospital names should be stored in alphabetical order and the first
#       hospital in that set should be chosen (i.e. if hospitals "b", "c", and "f"
#       are tied for best, then hospital "b" should be returned)

#Notes: We are looking at column 11 and 19
